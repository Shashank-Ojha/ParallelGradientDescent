1. Command line arguments
    - alpha
    - blocks
    - threads per block
2. Metadata in input files
    - Reference Slope
    - Standard Deviation
    - MSE
    - (Update code to parse values)
3. Time sgd_step function on driver
    - for CUDA and OpenMP
4. Clean up OpenMP designs and files
5. Look into playing with step_size and preventing overflow by dividing by N before adding rather than at the end

Together
1. Think through general designs and what limitations they have for each framework
    - parallelizing BGD on CUDA
2. Come up with new designs for each framework
    - Ex. CUDA take advantage of fast shared memory and have each block compute SGD independently
