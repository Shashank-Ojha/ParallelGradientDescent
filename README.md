# Parallelizing Gradient Descent on Different Architectures 
## Shashank Ojha and Kylee Santos


### Summary

We are going to create optimized implementations of gradient descent on both GPU and multi-core CPU platforms, and perform a detailed analysis of both systemsâ€™ performance characteristics. The GPU implementation will be done using CUDA, where as the multi-core CPU implementation will be done with OpenMP.
